# TODO

## Current Open Tasks

Date: 2026-06-21

- [x] **Provision Windows build toolchain and rerun rebuild validation**. Install
  the missing Windows build prerequisites needed by the source checkout
  (`cmake`, Visual Studio 2022 C++ Build Tools/MSBuild/MSVC, and Python test
  dependencies), then rerun the repository rebuild path from Windows using the
  existing helpers. Required validation: confirm the tools are discoverable,
  build the repo-local native `uimd.exe`, regenerate supported UIMD outputs,
  rebuild C++ examples, and record any remaining runtime/parity failures under
  their targeted TODO items. Result on 2026-06-21: Visual Studio Build Tools
  and the CMake MSI installers both exited with `1602` from the non-interactive
  winget/UAC path, so the environment was provisioned with portable CMake 4.3.3
  under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\uimd-build-tools` and WinLibs POSIX/UCRT GCC 16.1.0
  through winget. Added narrow source-checkout support for this path by guarding
  the non-MSVC `uimd_mcp_tester` CMake warning flags with `if(TARGET ...)`,
  honoring MinGW's existing `STDIN_FILENO`/`STDOUT_FILENO` macros, and teaching
  `uimd.cmd`/`uimd.ps1` to find `cpp\build-windows-mingw\tools\uimd\uimd.exe`.
  Validation passed: configured `cpp\build-windows-mingw` with Ninja, built the
  native `uimd.exe`, regenerated all configured Python/C++ dialogs, examples,
  tester UI, and parity regression outputs, built all C++ examples/regression
  binaries, ran CTest with `26/26` passing, and ran Python tests with
  `446 passed, 12 skipped, 3 subtests passed`. Remaining caveat: the default
  `tools\rebuild_all.cmd` Visual Studio path still requires an accepted Visual
  Studio Build Tools/MSBuild install, or a future helper option for the
  MinGW/Ninja build directory.
- [x] **Windows rebuild baseline validation**. Re-run the repository rebuild
  path on Windows from the source checkout to confirm the local environment can
  regenerate UIMD outputs and rebuild the native/C++ example targets after the
  recent Windows support work. Required validation: run the Windows rebuild
  helper from the repo root, record any missing toolchain/dependency blockers,
  and leave follow-up parity/runtime failures in their existing targeted TODO
  items rather than masking them. Result on 2026-06-21: PowerShell blocked
  `tools\rebuild_all.ps1` by execution policy; `tools\rebuild_all.cmd` found no
  system `python` except the Windows Store alias; running `tools\uimd_dev.py
  rebuild-all` with the bundled Codex Python reached the expected CMake
  configure step but failed because `cmake` is missing (`WinError 2`). `cmake`,
  `msbuild`, `cl`, `clang`, `g++`, and `ninja` are not on PATH, no repo-local
  `cpp\build-windows\tools\uimd\...\uimd.exe` exists yet, `cpp\build-windows`
  is absent, `winget list` reports no installed Kitware CMake or Visual Studio
  2022 Build Tools/Community package, and the bundled Python does not include
  `pytest`. The only validation that could run in this environment was Python
  syntax compilation for selected runtime/tester files, which passed. Full
  regeneration/build validation still requires provisioning a Windows C++ build
  toolchain and Python test dependencies.
- [ ] **Nested ScrollView edit-scope dim overlay has a one-column Python/C++
  edge mismatch**. While adding arrow navigation coverage to
  `stale_scrollview_focus`, pressing `Enter` on the focused `page.fields`
  ScrollView proxy correctly enters nested edit scope on both platforms, but
  compare reports Python dimming the rightmost host edge cell where C++ leaves
  the base background. Affected paths: Python
  `src/uimd/runtime/UIBase.py` active scrollview scope dim rectangle and
  `src/uimd/runtime/UIScrollView.py` proxy/self focus rendering; C++
  `cpp/src/generated/GeneratedWindowRuntime.cpp` `dimOutsideActiveScrollView`
  and generated child-window render clipping. Parity decision: this is render
  parity cleanup for active nested ScrollView scope, separate from paste routing
  and keyboard reachability.
- [ ] **C++ generated app startup errors must be visible on stderr**. When a
  generated C++ app fails before the runtime loop starts, for example because a
  `.uimd` file requires non-fallback Sixel images and `libsixel` is unavailable,
  the process must print a clear error message and exit nonzero instead of
  appearing to do nothing. Parity decision: this is C++ entrypoint/error
  reporting only; Python already raises a visible `SixelUnavailableError`, and
  runtime image fallback/Sixel rendering behavior must not be changed. Required
  validation: rebuild the affected C++ example/tool, run a C++ image example
  with Sixel unavailable, and verify stderr includes the dependency error.
- [ ] **Windows Sixel rendering can start without drawing visible images**.
  After installing/building native `libsixel-1.dll` through the Windows helper
  and setting `UIMD_LIBSIXEL_DIR`, Python `image_gallery` no longer fails the
  missing-dependency check and starts the app, but the user reports that no
  image is visibly drawn in the Windows SSH terminal. Current validation:
  `image._load_libsixel()` returns `True`, the app startup/render smoke emits
  terminal output without the missing-`libsixel` error, and C++/Python missing
  dependency messages are now actionable. Remaining work: determine whether the
  active Windows SSH/terminal path supports Sixel graphics, verify that Sixel
  escape sequences are actually emitted, decide whether runtime/doctor should
  warn or fall back when terminal graphics are unsupported, and keep macOS/Linux
  plus C++ behavior intact. Parity decision: this is terminal image capability
  detection/rendering behavior; do not change `.uimd` image semantics, non-image
  rendering, or existing macOS/Linux Sixel behavior without compare validation.
  Current Windows setup validation: `tools\install_sixel_windows.cmd` installed
  MSYS2 at `C:\msys64`, built `C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin\libsixel-1.dll`, installed
  `libsixel-python` into the local Windows Python venv, saved
  `UIMD_LIBSIXEL_DIR=C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin`, Python `_load_libsixel()` returns
  `True`, and `.\uimd.cmd doctor` reports C++ libsixel found from
  `UIMD_LIBSIXEL_DIR`.
- [ ] **Flatscraper admin project filters/table layout still differs between
  Python and C++ runtimes**. After the scrollview focus parity fix, the
  flatscraper admin compare still fails on the initial Projects page even
  though the Python and C++ `.uimd` sources are byte-for-byte equivalent. First
  reported mismatch: row 6 col 33, Python has a blank cell while C++ renders
  `A` from the Address filter label; C++ also appears to widen/shift filter
  columns, add an empty table row before the first project, and wrap address
  text differently. Initial investigation reproduced the first mismatch with
  the read-only compare and found it is introduced after generation by
  app-specific C++ code in `flatscraper_cpp_admin.cpp`:
  `ProjectsFilters::ProjectsFilters()` mutates generated layout widths/relative
  columns and changes `filter_address_label`, `filter_developer_label`, and
  `filter_extra_label` text by adding C++-only leading spaces. The generated
  Python/C++ `projects_filters` layout entries are otherwise equivalent. Before
  treating this as a remaining UIMD runtime bug, remove/sync those C++-only app
  layout/text overrides in `flatscraper-admin` and rerun compare; if table gap
  or address clipping mismatches remain after wrapper parity is restored, audit
  Python layout/text clipping in `src/uimd/runtime/UIBase.py` and
  `src/uimd/runtime/elements.py` against C++ layout/rendering in
  `cpp/src/generated/GeneratedWindowRuntime.cpp`,
  `cpp/src/elements/BasicElements.cpp`, and `cpp/src/elements/ScrollView.cpp`.
  Repro used the read-only flatscraper compare with
  `UIMD_DISABLE_SIXEL=1`, `FLATSCRAPER_UIMD_DIRECT_READONLY=1`, and the TSV
  fixture/snapshot so no admin data is mutated.
- [x] **Windows validation**: verify the new `image_button` control and the
  updated `image_browser` build and run on Windows for both Python and C++,
  confirming padding, centering, square sizing, click selection, and render-mode
  switching behave identically to macOS/Linux. Result on 2026-06-21: the
  Windows-only compare failure was caused by C++ `imageDisplayPath()` returning
  raw/generic slash-separated relative paths while Python `image_display_path()`
  resolves paths through `os.path.abspath()`/`os.path.relpath()`, which uses
  backslashes on Windows. C++ now mirrors the Python algorithm by absolutizing
  the source path against the project root, returning a relative path for
  project-local files, and using `std::filesystem::path::make_preferred()` for
  user-visible display text. Parity decision: this is example application data
  formatting, not image runtime rendering or Sixel behavior; macOS/Linux remain
  unchanged because their preferred separator is `/`. Validation passed:
  regenerated `python\examples\image_browser` for Python and
  `cpp\examples\image_browser` for C++, rebuilt
  `cpp\build-windows-mingw\examples\image_browser\image_browser.exe`, ran
  `image_browser.exe --logic-test`, ran
  `tests\mcp\image_browser_compare.yaml` with `--mcp-fast --compare-app-size
  90x35` (`113 asserts passed`), ran
  `tests\mcp\image_gallery_compare.yaml` with `--mcp-fast --compare-app-size
  90x35` (`13 asserts passed`), and reran CTest for the Windows MinGW build
  (`26/26` passed).
- [x] **Audit Windows path separator display parity beyond image_browser**.
  Check other user-visible Python/C++ paths and labels for the same
  slash/backslash mismatch class found in `image_browser`, especially standard
  dialogs, text/file examples, MCP tester output, and generator-emitted paths.
  Record which `generic_string()`/`relpath()` uses are intentionally
  slash-normalized internal paths versus OS-native display text, and fix any
  user-visible cross-platform parity bug found. Result on 2026-06-21: no second
  user-visible delimiter parity bug was found. `text_editor` displays only file
  basenames, and the standard `FileBrowser` full path label is covered by the
  Windows Python/C++ `text_editor` compare (`208 asserts passed`). The remaining
  `generic_string()` uses in `NativePythonGenerator` and `NativeCppGenerator`
  are intentional internal slash-normalized module/import/include paths rather
  than UI text. MCP tester relpaths are tester log/snapshot paths; the
  Python-only `_display_relpath()` intentionally normalizes to `/` for portable
  commands, while raw `os.path.relpath()` outputs are not Python/C++ UI compare
  surfaces. Extra validation: a Windows all-example compare run passed scripts
  1-12 of 13 before the 20-minute command timeout while running the final
  `expense_tracker` script, and the remaining
  `tests\mcp\expense_tracker_compare.yaml` passed separately (`116 asserts
  passed`).
- [ ] **Windows visual MCP tester window parity**. Windows MCP compare commands
  currently execute correctly through the Python tester's plain/console progress
  mode, but they do not show the same interactive UIMD tester window with
  side-by-side captured Python/C++ app panes that macOS/Linux can show through
  the POSIX PTY-backed tester path. Implement a Windows terminal capture backend
  for the tester, likely using ConPTY or an equivalent Windows pseudo-terminal
  primitive, so `.\uimd.cmd mcp-test --all --compare ...` can run with the
  visual tester UI on Windows without requiring `--headless` and without
  breaking the current POSIX PTY path. Parity decision: this is tester
  infrastructure only; generated examples, Python runtime app behavior, C++
  runtime behavior, MCP assertions, and POSIX macOS/Linux tester behavior must
  remain unchanged. Validation required: focused Windows visual compare with two
  app panes visible in the tester UI, full Windows compare smoke, full Python
  tests, and a POSIX/macOS smoke or documented audit showing the POSIX PTY path
  is untouched. Implemented progress: the Python tester now
  treats Windows interactive terminals as visual-tester capable, starts target
  apps through ConPTY only when the Windows API is available and a smoke test
  passes, and otherwise falls back to headless target processes while keeping
  the tester UI populated from MCP render frames. Focused validation passed:
  `python -m py_compile src\uimd\testing\mcp_tester.py` and
  `python -m pytest python\tests\test_mcp_tester.py -q` with
  `50 passed, 2 skipped, 2 warnings`; full `python -m pytest python\tests`
  with `435 passed, 18 skipped, 2 warnings`; and
  `cmd /c .\uimd.cmd mcp-test --plain --compare python\examples\activity_feed\activity_feed.py cpp\build-windows\examples\activity_feed\Release\activity_feed.exe tests\mcp\activity_feed.yaml --compare-app-size 90x35 --mcp-fast`
  with `47 asserts passed`. Earlier full Windows all-example compare runs
  reached `tests/mcp/image_browser_compare.yaml` before the display-path parity
  fix above; the Windows plain log output now escapes the unencodable `\u2580`
  character instead of crashing with `UnicodeEncodeError`. Remaining
  validation: user-visible interactive Windows SSH compare pane check, full
  compare smoke now that image_browser parity is fixed, and a POSIX/macOS smoke
  or documented audit.

## MCP Tester

- [ ] Add a performance benchmark/debug mode for C++ tester versus Python tester
  on representative compare viewports.
- [ ] Re-check compare/buffer-mode CPU cost after the C++ tester work and reduce
  remaining background repaint or snapshot polling overhead if it is still
  measurable.
- [ ] Improve failed-script summaries so the all-scripts summary includes the
  failing step number, target/platform, tool/assertion name, and first failure
  message.

## UIMD Admin

- [ ] After `ViewHost` exists, split UIMD admin top-level sections into separate
  UIMD views/layouts and host them inside the relevant shell/main panel instead
  of keeping them in one shared layout.

## Repository And Publishing

- [ ] Validate native `uimd` release artifacts as part of the Windows/Linux
  platform migration work, covering Linux x86_64, Linux arm64, Windows x86_64,
  and Windows arm64 where toolchains are available. This should include package
  install/bootstrap behavior, C++-only usage without Python installed, native
  `generate`, `doctor`, `sdk`, `inspect`, and MCP/rebuild smoke checks.
- [ ] Design and implement the long-term UIMD SDK Store/Launcher installation
  model before public packaging hardens.

  **SDK Store layout**: per-user root at `~/.uimd` on macOS/Linux and
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\uimd` on Windows, overridable via `UIMD_HOME`.
  ```
  ~/.uimd/
  ├── bin/uimd                        ← real launcher (owned by UIMD only)

  ```
  Examples are part of the SDK so users and agents can use them as reference
  and inspiration. Each SDK version ships its own examples; new features in a
  new version bring updated examples with them.
  Only the UIMD SDK manager may write into `~/.uimd/`. Package managers and
  pip never write into the SDK Store.
  SDK binaries and `uimd-init` are distributed via GitHub Releases at
  `https://github.com/uimd-lang/uimd` (primary source). `uimd-lang` is the
  GitHub organization name (following the rust-lang/golang convention); the
  tool and package are named `uimd` and `uimd-sdk` respectively. See the
  separate GitHub and publishing tasks below for the full publication checklist.

  **Delegation chain**: every entry point delegates via `exec()` (not subprocess
  spawn) to avoid latency stacking.
  ```
  /opt/homebrew/bin/uimd-init   ← installer binary (owned by brew)
  ~/.local/bin/uimd-init        ← installer binary (owned by pip)
        ↓ runs once, then exits
  ~/.uimd/bin/uimd              ← real launcher (owned by UIMD)
        ↓  exec()
  ~/.uimd/sdk/0.5.0/bin/uimd   ← versioned compiler for this project
  ```
  Package managers install only `uimd-init` — a small one-time installer binary
  whose version is the installer version, independent of any SDK version. The
  installer is rarely updated (only if the bootstrap mechanism changes).
  `uimd-init` is modelled after `rustup-init`: run once by the user, sets up
  `~/.uimd/`, optionally adds `~/.uimd/bin/` to shell PATH (`~/.zshrc`,
  `~/.bashrc`, PowerShell profile), then exits. Shell config changes must be
  explicit: use `uimd-init --modify-shell` for human installs that should edit
  shell startup files, and `uimd-init --no-shell-config` for agents/CI or users
  who want to manage PATH themselves. After setup the user works with `uimd`
  exclusively. `brew upgrade uimd-sdk` updates only the `uimd-init` binary;
  `~/.uimd/bin/uimd` is updated exclusively via `uimd self update`.
  `uimd-init` always verifies the installation state, not just the existence of
  `~/.uimd/` — it checks launcher binary integrity and Python SDK presence, and
  repairs or re-downloads anything missing or corrupted. If everything is valid
  it exits immediately as a no-op.
  `uimd-init` prints setup instructions itself when `~/.uimd/` is missing or
  incomplete; no pip or brew post-install hook is used for messaging.
  `uimd-init` must support fully non-interactive agent/CI operation. Agents run
  `uimd-init --no-shell-config`, skip shell startup file edits, and then call
  `~/.uimd/bin/uimd` directly by full path. `uimd doctor --json` can be used to
  check installation state before deciding whether to run `uimd-init`.

  **Default target**: every `uimd-init` run always installs the Python target
  (`targets/python/`) because Python is the default compilation target and
  `uimd compile` without a language flag compiles Python. Other targets (C++,
  C#, etc.) are installed on demand when first used: `uimd compile --cpp`
  triggers a silent auto-install of `targets/cpp/` if not present. This
  guarantees agents and users never wait for a download on the default Python
  path; a download only occurs the first time a non-default target is requested,
  which is acceptable.

  **Version resolution**: the required SDK version is declared once in the
  project's root/top-level `.uimd` file, not in every component `.uimd` file.
  The launcher finds the root `.uimd`, reads the SDK version from its `##
  Metadata`, and selects the highest installed SDK version that satisfies
  `>=required_version`. Component `.uimd` files inherit the root SDK version.
  If the satisfying version crosses a minor-series boundary (e.g. root requires
  0.5.0 but only 0.6.x is installed), the launcher emits a warning and runs
  with the available version; update the root `.uimd` Metadata to silence it. If
  no satisfying version is installed, the launcher auto-installs the latest
  patch of the required minor series unless offline mode disables downloads.
  Backward compatibility within a minor series is guaranteed. The SDK version
  in the root `.uimd` Metadata is recommended, but not mandatory. New projects
  created by `uimd new` should include it. If a root `.uimd` file has no SDK
  version in Metadata, the launcher uses the latest installed SDK version as a
  legacy/quick-start fallback and emits a reproducibility warning such as:
  "root .uimd has no UIMD SDK version; using installed SDK 0.6.2; add
  sdk-version to Metadata for reproducible builds." Strict contexts may opt in
  to failure with `--require-sdk-version` or `UIMD_REQUIRE_SDK_VERSION=1`.
  Feature/element heuristics may be used only for diagnostics such as "this
  source uses Image and requires at least 0.5.0"; heuristics must not be the
  primary SDK version selection mechanism. `uimd.toml` is optional and used only
  for project-level overrides (e.g. `UIMD_SDK_PATH`); it does not declare the
  SDK version. `uimd init` creates a `uimd.toml` template with commented-out
  override options.

  **Auto-install**: all downloads and installs happen automatically and silently
  with no confirmation prompt, for both interactive users and agents. A download
  mid-task (e.g. first C++ compile) is acceptable; the command completes after
  the download finishes. Set `UIMD_NO_AUTO_INSTALL=1` or pass `--offline` to
  disable all network access, SDK downloads, target downloads, and repair
  downloads for that command; if required SDK/target files are missing, the
  command must fail fast with a clear error and exact install/ensure command.

  **Python package split**: `pip install uimd` installs the Python UIMD runtime
  package only. It is for users running Python UIMD applications that report
  missing UIMD Python libraries, and it must not install, bootstrap, or manage
  the SDK. `pip install uimd-sdk` is a separate developer/agent bootstrap
  package that installs `uimd-init` only.

  **Bootstrap entry points**:
  - `brew install uimd-sdk` — installs `uimd-init`; prints post-install message
    "To complete installation run: uimd-init"; `brew upgrade uimd-sdk` updates
    `uimd-init` only
  - `pip install uimd-sdk` — installs `uimd-init`; prints the same post-install
    message; skips SDK download if `~/.uimd/` already exists
  - `winget install uimd-sdk` / `apt install uimd-sdk` — same model
  Every package manager prints the same post-install message so both users and
  agents know to run `uimd-init` (or `uimd-init --no-shell-config` for agents).
  Since `uimd-init` is a no-op when `~/.uimd/` already exists, agents may
  always call it unconditionally after any package manager install.

  **SDK manager commands**: `uimd sdk install <version>`,
  `uimd sdk install-target <target>` (e.g. `cpp`, `csharp`),
  `uimd sdk list`, `uimd sdk remove <version>`, `uimd sdk use <version>`,
  `uimd sdk update` (latest patch of current minor series),
  `uimd sdk prune` (keep last 2 patches per minor series, remove the rest).
  Launcher: `uimd self update`, `uimd self uninstall`.
  Diagnostics: `uimd doctor --json`, `uimd sdk list --json` (for agents/CI).
  Project init: `uimd init` creates `uimd.toml` template with commented-out
  project-level override options.

  **Development override**: `UIMD_SDK_PATH=<path>` bypasses the SDK Store and
  points the launcher at a local SDK build; required when developing UIMD itself.

  **Uninstall**: `brew uninstall uimd-sdk` removes only the brew shim; `~/.uimd/`
  is untouched. To fully remove UIMD run `uimd self uninstall` first, then
  uninstall via the package manager.

  **Platform packaging**: generated C++ apps prefer static linking so end users
  need no UIMD runtime installed. C#/other compiled targets are similarly bundled
  into the built app. Python apps import the runtime from the SDK Store via
  PYTHONPATH injection by the launcher; no pip dependency is needed at app
  runtime.

  Remaining implementation gaps: package-manager recipes and cross-platform
  validation.
- [ ] Verify that the PyPI package name `uimd` is available before the first
  public release.
- [ ] Confirm GitHub repository description is set to:
  `User Interface Markdown. Define app interfaces in Markdown and generate UI
  and agent access.`
- [ ] Confirm GitHub repository topics are set:
  `markdown`, `ui`, `mcp`, `code-generation`, `terminal-ui`, `python`, `cpp`.
- [ ] Decide how the current SVN source of truth maps to GitHub publication.
- [ ] Configure PyPI Trusted Publisher for repository `uimd-lang/uimd` once the
  package is ready to publish.

## Layout Migration

- [ ] Retire or migrate the existing root `python/` layout after package files,
  tests, and examples have moved to their final locations.
- [ ] Move Python tests into the public test layout, keeping them able to test
  the installed `uimd` package rather than repository-local imports.
- [ ] Move Python examples into the public examples layout or document why
  backend-specific examples remain under their backend directory.
- [ ] Finalize the public repository layout:
  `pyproject.toml`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `src/uimd/`, `cpp/`, `shared/`,
  `docs/`, `examples/`, `tests/`, and `tools/`.

## Validation

- [ ] Verify clean install into a fresh virtualenv on Windows.
- [ ] Verify `python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/uimd-lang/uimd.git`
  once the GitHub repository is populated.
- [ ] Verify `uimd run hello.uimd` from a clean external project.
- [ ] Verify C++ hello-world flow from a clean external project after the first
  public GitHub release/tag, without relying on a sibling `../uimd/cpp`
  checkout.
